0.6   Sun Feb 20
      Added tests for the cut, number, and clause classes.

      Added stub tests for step and primitive classes.

      Ensured that all classes at least had stub documentation and added
      POD tests.

      Updated the TODO list in AI::Prolog.

0.5   Sun Feb 13
      Put the database into its own class.

      Pulled engine backtracking out into its own method.

      Reduced the scope of many of the Engine::_run variables to ensure data
      wasn't leaking.

      Added simple "aiprolog" shell.

      Added cut operator, retract(X), and assert(X).

      Added more examples and simple adventure game to both demonstrate the shell
      and how Prolog works.

      Completely reworked the engine internals to allow new predicates to be
      easily added.

      * XXX Also screwed up the numbering scheme.  Grumble XXX *

0.04  Sun Jan 30
      Added support for quoting terms.  
      
      Added Engine->formatted method which allows results to be returned as
      either strings or as data structures.  The latter is more useful.

      When using AI::Prolog, the results() method now returns a "results"
      object.

      The AI::Prolog interface has been cleaned up and use of the supporting
      modules is now officially discouraged.

      Massive documentation update.

0.03  Sun Jan 23
      Added tests for built-in predicates.

      Added query() function to AI::Logic::Engine to allow successive queries
      without a new bootstrap.

0.02  Sun Jan 23
      First public release of AI::Prolog.
