Revision history for Perl extension AI::Prolog.

0.04  Sun Jan 30
      Added support for quoting terms.  
      
      Added Engine->formatted method which allows results to be returned as
      either strings or as data structures.  The latter is more useful.

      When using AI::Prolog, the results() method now returns a "results"
      object.

      The AI::Prolog interface has been cleaned up and use of the supporting
      modules is now officially discouraged.

      Massive documentation update.

0.03  Sun Jan 23
      Added tests for built-in predicates.

      Added query() function to AI::Logic::Engine to allow successive queries
      without a new boostrap.

0.02  Sun Jan 23
      First public release of AI::Prolog.
